# Summary
Madoka is a private Youtube Live ROM (Read-only Member) player made by Electron.
Depending on the input of the video ID, we can look up to the comments at the real time.
Also, we use the Shuvi-lib to operate on the Youtube IFrame Player.

     The player panel operates like a window. At the bottom on the player, you can input the video ID and push on Enter or click the search icon to play the video.

     On the top right of the player, if you click the "Hamburger Menu mark", the comment window will appear.
     The comments are taken by the Youtube API.
     If you click on the left arrow, the comments windows will disappear.
